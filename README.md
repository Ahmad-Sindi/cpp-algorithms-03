🚀 Algorithm Challenge #3 – Even or Odd Checker in C++
🧠 Problem Statement

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number, then determines whether the number is even or odd, and displays the appropriate message.

✅ Language Used

C++

💡 What You'll Learn

Basic C++ program structure

Using std::cin and std::cout for input and output

Applying the modulo operator % for logic

Using if-else conditional statements

Understanding integer arithmetic and condition checks

📝 Solution Description

In this simple challenge, the program does the following:

Prompts the user to enter an integer.

Uses the expression number % 2 to check divisibility by 2.

If the result is 0, the number is even.

Otherwise, the number is odd.

🧪 Sample Output
Enter the number
7
The number is ODD

Enter the number
12
The number is EVEN
